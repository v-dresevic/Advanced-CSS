        <p>The cla&hyphen;ssic longest German word is Donaudamp&shy;fschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapit√§n, clocking in with 42 letters. In
            English,
            it becomes four words: "Danube steamship company captain." However, it's not the only super long word in the
            German
            language and, technically, it's not even the longest.</p>
